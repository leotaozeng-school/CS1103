**Exception Handling** and **String Handling** in Java serves as a crucial component of the course, bridging the gap between fundamental programming concepts and more advanced software development practices. They are fundamental building blocks for writing robust, user-friendly applications.

Exception handling is the art of managing errors and exceptions gracefully in our code, ensuring that software remains robust and reliable. We will learn how to use try-catch blocks, throw and throws keywords, and handle different types of exceptions. Additionally, we will delve into the world of strings, understanding their importance in working with textual data and harnessing the power of Java's string handling capabilities.
