# Overview
**Exception Handling** and **String Handling** in Java serves as a crucial component of the course, bridging the gap between fundamental programming concepts and more advanced software development practices. They are fundamental building blocks for writing robust, user-friendly applications.

Exception handling is the art of managing errors and exceptions gracefully in our code, ensuring that software remains robust and reliable. We will learn how to use **try-catch blocks, throw and throws keywords**, and handle different **types of exceptions**. Additionally, we will delve into the world of strings, understanding their importance in working with textual data and harnessing the power of **Java's string handling capabilities**.

## Assignment Instructions
This assignment aims to assess your skills/knowledge on basics of String creation and various string handling functions. This is a scenario based practical assignment to create a text analysis tool, providing students with a hands-on opportunity to apply their programming skills in a real-world context. The assignment focuses on developing a program that performs various operations on text input, enhancing students' skills in handling strings, data analysis, and user interaction. 

**Scenario:** You have been asked to create a text analysis tool that will perform various operations on a given text input. This tool will help users gain insights into the text data by performing character and word analysis.  

## Assignment Tasks: 

1. **User Input:** Ask the user to input a paragraph or a lengthy text. Your program should read and store this input.  

2. **Character Count:** Calculate and display the total number of characters in the input text.  

3. **Word Count:** Calculate and display the total number of words in the input text. Assume that words are separated by spaces.  

4. **Most Common Character:** Find and display the most common character in the text. In case of a tie, select any of the tied characters.  

5. **Character Frequency:** Ask the user to input a character. Check and display the frequency of occurrences of this character in the text. Be case-insensitive (e.g., 'a' and 'A' should be considered the same character).  

6. **Word Frequency:** Ask the user to input a word. Check and display the frequency of occurrences of this word in the text. Be case-insensitive.  

7. **Unique Words:** Calculate and display the number of unique words in the text (case-insensitive).
