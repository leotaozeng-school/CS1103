## Assignment Title: Simple Clock Application
Through this assignment, you will gain knowledge and skills in understanding the basics of the Java Thread model. You will also be able to gain your skills in the implementation of multithreading concepts and the usage of thread priorities for task prioritization in a real-life clock application.

## Assignment Instructions
**Scenario:** You are tasked with developing a simple clock application that utilizes Java threads to display the current time and date concurrently. This project aims to explore the Java Thread model and its basics while illustrating the use of threads and their priorities in a straightforward real-life scenario. 

## Assignment Tasks:
1. **Clock Class:**
   - Create a **Clock** class responsible for displaying the current time and date.
   - Implement a method to continuously update and print the current time.

2. **Thread Implementation:**
   - Utilize Java threads to ensure that the clock continuously updates its time in the background.
   - Implement a separate thread for printing the time to the console.

3. **Thread Priorities:**
   - Introduce thread priorities for better timekeeping precision.
   - The clock display thread should have a higher priority than the background updating thread.

4. **Simulation Output:**
   - Display the current time and date in a readable format, e.g., "HH:mm:ss dd-MM-yyyy".
   - Ensure that the clock continuously updates the time.
